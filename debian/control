Description: Full-fledged web application server
 OpenResty (aka. ngx_openresty) is a full-fledged web
 application server by bundling the standard Nginx core,
 lots of 3rd-party Nginx modules, as well as most of
 their external dependencies.
 This package is built for TileMan tile manager application,
 but useful for other applications because there is NOT
 any special binary/library chunk compiled in.
